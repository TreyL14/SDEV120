// This pseudocode is intended to determine whether students have
// passed or failed a course; student needs to average 60 or
// more on two tests. 

Corrections:
1. Add an input statement for firstTest
2. Change "not equal to" to <>
3. Include parentheses around firstTest + secondTest in the average calculation
4. Correct spelling of "output"
5. Add an additional input statement for firstTest
